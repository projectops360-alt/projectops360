# 10 — Regression Log

A regression is functionality that was working or intended and was lost, hidden, or degraded.
Every regression is tracked here until Resolved. Fields: Description · Observed · Expected ·
Impact · Severity · Investigation status · Owner · Next action.

> Root cause for most entries: the `master` vs `feat/rythm` divergence (see DEBT-001). A large
> body of work never reached `master` after the post-divergence rebuild.

## REG-001 — Possible loss of manual Team Member creation
- **Description:** Ability for a PM/PMO to manually add a named team member.
- **Observed:** Needs verification on current `master`.
- **Expected:** PM/PMO can add a brand-new named member directly.
- **Impact:** Team setup blocked if absent. **Severity:** High.
- **Investigation status:** **Likely PRESENT on `master`** via team onboarding PRs (#7, #8, #10).
  Must be confirmed by exercising the `/team` flow. → mark **Unknown** until verified.
- **Owner:** TBD. **Next action:** verify `/team` create-member on `master`; close or escalate.

## REG-002 — Possible loss of Team Member rename/edit
- **Description:** Inline rename/edit of a project or workspace member.
- **Observed:** Needs verification.
- **Expected:** Rename pencil always visible; edits persist (incl. cross-org profiles).
- **Impact:** Stale/incorrect names. **Severity:** Medium-High.
- **Investigation status:** **Likely PRESENT on `master`** (PRs #8, #11 "rename pencil always
  visible", "profiles read by id"). Confirm by exercising. → **Unknown** until verified.
- **Next action:** verify rename on `/team`.

## REG-003 — Possible loss of user creation with email/password
- **Description:** Create a login (email + temporary password) without SMTP; forced
  first-login password change.
- **Observed:** Needs verification.
- **Expected:** Member gets a temp-password login; can change it on first sign-in.
- **Impact:** Onboarding blocked. **Severity:** High.
- **Investigation status:** **Likely PRESENT on `master`** (PR #7, #9 new-user-creation guards).
  → **Unknown** until verified.
- **Next action:** verify create-login flow end-to-end.

## REG-004 — Resource Capacity / Labor Capacity vision lost
- **Description:** Resource Capacity Intelligence module (utilization, overhead, availability,
  health) disappeared from `master`.
- **Observed:** Module + `/resource-capacity` route absent on `master` before 2026-06-27; lived
  only on `feat/rythm`; migration `20260812` was applied to prod but code was missing.
- **Expected:** Full Resource Capacity Intelligence per ADR-003 / doc 13.
- **Impact:** Core P3 capability invisible. **Severity:** Critical.
- **Investigation status:** **RESTORED 2026-06-27 (PR #23)** — engine + page + editor + migration
  back on `master`, deployed to prod. Vision depth (forecast/burnout/simulation) still open.
- **Owner:** Product. **Next action:** implement depth per doc 13; keep CAP-009 honest.

## REG-005 — Living Graph prominence reduced / not as intended
- **Description:** Living Graph enhancements (Workforce layer, executive insights, graph-first
  layout, recalculate, live status) lost on `master`; graph risked becoming decorative.
- **Observed:** 11 LG commits on `feat/rythm` never reached `master`; the 5 core LG files were
  frozen on `master`.
- **Expected:** Living Graph as primary intelligence/navigation surface (ADR-002 / doc 12).
- **Impact:** Strategic surface degraded. **Severity:** High.
- **Investigation status:** **PARTIALLY RESTORED 2026-06-27 (PR #23)** — enhancements back; the
  broader "primary navigation/impact surface + status-engine + Isabella explanations" vision is
  still open.
- **Next action:** doc 12 roadmap; wire Execution Status Engine; node Blocked/Waiting fix.

## REG-006 — Confusing Blocked vs Waiting-on-Dependency
- **Description:** A single "Blocked" state represents multiple execution scenarios; items
  merely waiting for predecessors are shown as Blocked (lock icon).
- **Observed:** `living-graph-node.tsx` renders a lock for `isBlocked`; milestone status conflates
  blocked/at_risk; no distinct "Waiting on Dependency."
- **Expected:** Independent dimensions; Blocked only with an explicit impediment (ADR-006).
- **Impact:** Misleads PMs about reality. **Severity:** High.
- **Investigation status:** **OPEN.** Execution Status Engine prototype (`status-engine.ts`,
  doc 18) implements the correct rules but is **not wired**.
- **Owner:** Product. **Next action:** wire the engine into the Living Graph + Isabella (doc 18).
